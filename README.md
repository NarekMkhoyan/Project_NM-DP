# Project DP

## To Do list / Brainstorming

1. market research for useful functionality

2. time select
3. multiple day selection (ionic)
4. highlighted days (extra features from ionic)

## In Development

1. Layout with custom templates
2. allow clear
3. invalid(red) and warning states

## Bugs
1. test
  1.1 in-range dates are hardly visible in dark mode (text color should be inverted)
  1.2 swipe animation redo(ionic)
  1.3 flickering colors when openning a selector or hovering the year value in month mode (dp 5-6)
  1.4 in-range month and years have gaps
3. log testing on how many times the code runs (e.g. date-mode.service generateDays works 2 times)
